There are 2 types of collaborators - **collaborator** and **super collaborator**. Both of them can edit the world, but super collaborator has more rights.

### Collaborator

- edit introduction post
- rearrange categories in menu
- create new post and assign them to categories

### Super collaborator

- change name, "based on" and short description
- change tags
- change images - header, avatar and thumbnail
- approve other collaborators, make them super collaborators or remove them
